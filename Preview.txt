So far in my visual rhetoric project, I have the basic outline of my future image’s argument set. First, on one side of my image, I have a background of a dandelion filled plain with a mountain range and blue sky. On the foreground of that background is an image of a girl with a bright smile holding a flower. Then on the other side of the image is a background of a very dark room lit up with only a small amount of light. The room looks like it’s made of a metal wall. Then on the foreground of that background is an image of a girl curled up as if she is crying. The two sides of the images are placed side by side to emphasize the two sides depicted in my argument. In my argument, the deceptive yet happy face that people wear to hide their true emotion is represented by the side with the dandelion field and the happy girl. The dark side of the image represents a person’s true emotions that they are hiding behind their fake smile. The metal wall of the room resembles that of a prison, where the crying girl is trapped inside of. 
So far, this project has been a challenge to me. Although I had concrete ideas about what I wanted to represent in my image in my proposal, putting my words into pictures and a few words proved to be quite difficult. I realized that using a mirror to compare the two sides of my rhetoric proved to be difficult. Using the concept of a mirror in my rhetoric, which is a 2-dimensional image could be hard to show. Now that I have the baseline for my project set, I am going to focus more on the smaller details on how I can connect my two polar opposite concepts in my rhetoric into a solidified, meaningful argument.
